# Overview

This is a tool designed to calculate the minimum capital gains tax a person can pay in Australia.
It is not intended to handle capital gains from real estate or physical asset, but gains made from trading/investing in stocks and ETFs.
The final product is intended to be a webpage where a user inputs a `.csv` file with all their trade history and they recieve a `.xlsx` file with a summary of their taxable capital gain.
